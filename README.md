Pneumonia Detection using deep learning models on X-Ray images

Name - Shikha Tiwari

Project Description - Pneumonia Detection using ResNet50 and VGG16

The aim of this project is to develop an automated system for identifying lung opacities in chest
X-rays, primarily for the RSNA Pneumonia Detection Challenge. We propose to utilize the Resnet-50 and VGG-16, a convolutional neural network (CNN) commonly used for medical image segmentation task and compared the performance.

File Description - 
  a) pneumonia_resnet50.py - This code will import pretrained RESNET50 model and train it on pneumonia dataset.
  b) pneumonia_vgg16.py - This code will import pretrained VGG16 model and train it on pneumonia dataset.
  c) Pneumonia_detection_report - Explain the project, relevant works done, explained resnet50, vgg16 model and work done containing     comparison of both the models.
